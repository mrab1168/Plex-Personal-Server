The following is the current workflow that I have

1) Ombi to request media 
2) Sonarr* get that request and quality etc. 
3) Sonarr adds it to the list of TV Shows
4) Jackett finds the torrent and sends it Sonarr for processing
5) Sonarr sends the torrent mag link to Deluge
6) Since the API knows that this is from Sonarr, it takes the the information that is different for Sonarr i.e. where the file should be on seed in this case X drive (If it was from Radarr it would be labeled as such and sent to the local B drive)
7) Plex and sonarr gets that information and sends a copy to my root dir..
  a) for TV Shows its M:/PLex/TV Shows
  b) for Movies its M:/Plex/Movies
8) Root dir is a FUSE mounted rclone program that is an encrpytted G Drive
9) -> uploads encrypted to Google Drive --> Plx scans and finds it

Once I fully install my NVMe SSD and move a 1TB drive to my main driver with use the 1TB as a cache



*Sonarr is used for TV Shows. Radarr is the movie equivalent

These are the enhavments that I want to work on:

a) have rclone/Sonarr only upload at night at 2:30 AM PST (UTC+0 7:30AM)
b) using personal domain name, create a login page
c) be able to VNC troubleshoot via web
d) Learn rclone cache command. May solve a
e) nssm rclone mount changes log log each day
f) find out way Rick and Moprty wasnt wortking on MAy 18 7-8 PM
g) Change to a Liunux base system
  i) drive pooling the rclone wiht a local drive to cache
